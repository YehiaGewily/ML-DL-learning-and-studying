# Machine Learning From Scratch

## Overview
This repository contains my personal implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal of this project is to deeply understand the mathematics and mechanics behind these algorithms by building them without high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn.

## Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression)** | Implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent. |
| **[Logistic Regression](./Logistic%20Regression)** | Binary classification algorithm using the sigmoid function. |
| **[Decision Tree](./DecisionTree)** | Implementation of ID3/CART decision trees. |
| **[Random Forest](./Random%20Forest)** | Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees. |
| **[Naive Bayes](./Naive%20Bayes)** | Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. |
| **[K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](./KNN)** | Non-parametric method used for classification and regression. |
| **[Support Vector Machine (SVM)](./SVM)** | Linear SVM implementation using Hinge Loss. |
| **[Perceptron](./Perceptron)** | The fundamental unit of Neural Networks. |
| **[AdaBoost](./AdaBoost)** | Boosting technique to combine weak classifiers. |
| **[Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)](./LDA)** | Dimensionality reduction technique. |
| **[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](./PCA)** | Unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction. |
| **[K-Means Clustering](./K-Means%20Clustering)** | Unsupervised algorithm for partitioning data into k clusters. |

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Usage
Each directory contains a self-contained implementation. You can typically run the demonstration script within each module:

```bash
cd "Linear Regression"
python main.py
```
